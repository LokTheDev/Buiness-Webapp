I used to create a database system with JAVA.
This is my first time using javascript on database.
Therefore, this project could be more functionable with the update function.
In the future I'll make a new one with Put/Patch instead of just put.
And I can write better code with chain methodd(.get.post.put etc...)

Anyways, check out my Restful API. It's a really sipme project that is my get/post/patch/put/delete show case:)
also with routing params!
